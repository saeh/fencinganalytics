# Fencing Analyics

This is a quick streamlit app to pull data from fencingtimelive and filter it so that lists of fencers can be downloaded.

## Quickstart

App is available [here](https://saeh-fencinganalytics-fencing-app-yy12dh.streamlitapp.com/):


## Usage

1. Select date range, this will find all the tournaments in a particular time range
2. Next find and select the fencing tournaments you are interested in. By default none will be selected. Both search and dropdown functionality is available
3. Once tournaments are selected by default all the events will be selected in the next section. Review these and remove any not required
4. Initially the results table will be empty, pick one or more clubs to fetch the fencers from that club that are competing.
